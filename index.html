          I'm a student of the University of S達o Paulo, and I'm currently studying Informational Systems. I am from a small city in the state of S達o Paulo, Brazil. More recently I've developed a passion for coding and creating projects to understand different subjects. I'm currently working on a project called "matheusode.me" (the website you're on right now) which is also for developing new abilities in coding and to make sure I remember to do my own projects.
